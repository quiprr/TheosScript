# First off:

This script uses code from [dragon](https://github.com/DragonBuild/Installer) and my own code. I would like to heavily thank Kritanta for open sourcing dragon and DragonBuild's install script, as this project wouldn't have been possible without it.

# How to install

```bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ajaidan0/theosscript/master/setup.sh)```

# Install Theos

Once you have ran ```setup.sh```, run ```theos -cl```. After that is finished, run ```theos -inst```. Congratulations, theos is now installed!

Note: Best used in conjunction with [mpi](https://github.com/samoht9277/mpi)
